            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Uber, live monitoring and automation of Ops is critical to preserve marketplace health, maintain reliability, and gain efficiency in markets. By the virtue of the word “live”, this monitoring needs to show what is happening now, with prompt access to fresh data, and the ability to recommend appropriate actions based on that data. Uber’s data platform provides the self-serve tools which empower the Ops teams to build their own live monitoring tools, and support their regional teams by building rich solutions.</p><p>For this project, the requirement was to provide merchant level monitoring and handle the edge cases which remain unaddressed by the sophisticated internal marketplace management tools. We used a variety of Uber’s real-time data platform components to build a tool called Charon to reduce impact of poor marketplace reliability on the merchants.</p><p>Read More at <a href="https://eng.uber.com/charon/">https://eng.uber.com/charon/</a></p><p><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deliverDoor@3x-768x263.png" alt="Operating Apache Pinot at Uber Scale"/></p>]]></content:encoded>

In Apache Pinot’s case, upsert isn’t precisely the same concept, and I wanted to write this blog post to explain why it’s exciting and how you can start using it.</p><p>Read More at <a href="https://medium.com/apache-pinot-developer-blog/introduction-to-upserts-in-apache-pinot-987c12149d93">https://medium.com/apache-pinot-developer-blog/introduction-to-upserts-in-apache-pinot-987c12149d93</a></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*So3GjHjLY7DJAiaP" alt="Introduction to Upserts in Apache Pinot"/></p>]]></content:encoded>
