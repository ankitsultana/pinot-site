By the virtue of the word “live”, this monitoring needs to show what is happening now, with prompt access to fresh data, and the ability to recommend appropriate actions based on that data. Uber’s data platform provides the self-serve tools which empower the Ops teams to build their own live monitoring tools, and support their regional teams by building rich solutions.</p><p>For this project, the requirement was to provide merchant level monitoring and handle the edge cases which remain unaddressed by the sophisticated internal marketplace management tools.
